* Ensures at least **1 year of daily commits** even if your account is newer.
* Randomizes **1‚Äì3 commits per day** to make contribution graphs appear natural.
* Allows **reversing all commits**, creating a fresh repository state.
* Generates commits with **random timestamps per day**.

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install jsonfile moment simple-git axios
   ```

3. **Edit the script**

   * Open `index.js`.
